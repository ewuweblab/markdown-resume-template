## Biography

<div>CEO and Software Engineer with knowledge of applied information theory, including optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants.Richard invented and built the start-up Pied Piper. After winning the TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon at the end of the first season, and receiving more funding from investors, Richard is even more determined to make Pied Piper a company different from Hooli. After winning the competition, Richard is more determined to put Pied Piper's name on the map - constantly making new applications for his algorithm like a videochat and artificial intelligence, but his poor people skills unpredictable-but-frequent mood swings, and lack of business training make him a poor CEO - and he constantly gets into spats with other people for small reasons as a result.</div>
